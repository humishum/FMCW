# What is FMCW? 
Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave(FMCW) is a type of transmission system in which a "continuous" carrier is swept/chirped in frequency in a known manner. This is in contrast to pulsed transmission systems in which the system would send out an impulse signal at known times. Of course, there's a plethora of differences, which we will go into further detail below.
